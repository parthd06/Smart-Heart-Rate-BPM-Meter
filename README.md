# Smart-Heart-Rate-BPM-Meter

## Introduction:
- There are many low-cost pulse sensors in the market that can be used to make a pulse BPM meter, but when it comes to accuracy and stability, the sensors are not
reliable.
- This project describes the design of a very low-cost device which measures the heart rate of the subject and then displays the result.

## Problem Statement:
To develop a heart rate monitoring system using an SEN-11574 pulse sensor and display heart rate value on a web/ mobile application using a HC-05 Bluetooth
module.

## Conclusion:
- It is a low-cost project and highly effective. 
- One could afford it and implement it easily.
- Due to absence of complex features, the designed device can also be handled by any non-medical professionals. Thus it can also be used at home.

### Future Scope:
- The pulse sensor SEN-11574 readings can be affected by surrounding noises as it is a relatively open sensor and not an enclosed one. The developed device is not a portable one. 
- In future a sensor that is enclosed can be incorporated. The accuracy of the project will improve as the sensor’s readings will not be affected by background noises.
- The user interface can also be improved and made more user friendly.
