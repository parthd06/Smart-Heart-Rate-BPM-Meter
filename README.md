# Smart-Heart-Rate-BPM-Meter

## Introduction:
- There are many low-cost pulse sensors in the market that can be used to make a pulse BPM meter, but when it comes to accuracy and stability, the sensors are not
reliable.
- This project describes the design of a very low-cost device which measures the heart rate of the subject by clipping sensors on one of the fingers and then displaying the result.

## Problem Statement:
To develop a heart rate monitoring system using an SEN-11574 pulse sensor and display heart rate value on an web/ mobile application using a HC-05 Bluetooth
module.

## Conclusion:
- In this project, we used linear regression for evaluating individual health insurance data. The predicted premiums from this model was compared with actual premiums to compare the accuracy of the model.
- Various factors were used and their effect on predicted amount was examined. It was observed that a person’s age and smoking status affects the recommendation most. 
- Premium amount recommendation focuses on person’s own health rather than other company’s insurance terms and conditions. The models can be applied to the data collected in coming years to recommend the premium. This can help not only people but also insurance companies to work in tandem for better and more health centric insurance amount.

### Future Scope:
- The current machine learning model is limited to accurate predictions of the specific age group hence in future scope we can increase the quality and accuracy of the dataset. 
- The user interface can be improved and buying of new policies can be  incorporated. 
- Inclusion of more parameters like chronic diseases, number of surgeries can be used in the future for better cost recommendation.
